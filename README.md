# Language Game
12DIT Project management task
My outcome is to create a language game that has an uncertain reward.
My reward is double or nothing, so you have to choose to bank your points.
# Instructions:
Hei og velkommen. This is the Norwegian language game.
It is a great fun and exciting way to practice your Norwegian skills. 
To play simply translate the words on screen, if you get a 
question right you have the option to double your points if 
you get the next question right or you can play it safe and bank the points.
You only have three wrong guesses before the game is over though so be careful.
